# Music History

This is the project that you will be working for your individual work throughout the entire front end course. Don't worry, you'll be building lots of other applications, but when you learn a new technique, library or language, you'll be cutting your teeth with it on Music History.

I've started you off with a very basic HTML document, the `index.html` file. This file name is the default file that most any web server looks for in the directory in which is was started. This is why you don't have to type in `www.google.com/index.html`. If the file exists, the web server sends it back to you if you just request the root URL.

> **Terminology:** Root URL simply means your domain name (or IP address) with no other documents, or folders specified. `www.google.com` is the root URL of Google's web site, but `www.google.com/finance` is not.

>##Music History Part 2

Setup

Create a branch in your musichistory repository named version2.
Switch to that branch.
Requirements

Use JavaScript arrays, loops, and innerHTML to show the music you love.

Students must use JavaScript to create a list of songs in the index.html file for their Music History project. Have them download the songs.js file, which contains an array of strings with song information.

Each student must add one song to the beginning and the end of the array.
Loop over the array and remove any words or characters that obviously don't belong.
Students must find and replace the > character in each item with a - character.
Must add each string to the DOM in index.html in the main content area.

{Song name} by {Artist} on the album {Album}
Merging your branch

After you've got all of the requirements completed, follow these steps.

In your musichistory directory, enter the command git checkout master. This switches you back to the master branch.
git merge -X theirs version2
If you see a vim screen with a default message in it just :x to save and exit.
Your branch is now merged into the master branch and you can push the master branch up to Github with git push origin master.
